## About the blog

I started this blog due to some blog-fashion years back. I actually have no idea what to put here: most of my works are neither impressive, or interesting, or unique enough to be considered worth reading.

If you take a look at those old blog posts you should be able to see that they are more like recording how I approach problems instead of organizing them into something more friendly to readers.

In the future I plan to write more like reports that clearly explains what's the problem, why the problem, how to analyze, and evaluate result.

## About me

I'm a programmer. I write most of my projects using python, and currently learning Rust.
