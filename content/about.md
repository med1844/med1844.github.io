## About me

I'm a programmer. I currently work at YouTube, writing C++ for a living. After work, I contribute to open source projects that's written in Rust.

I have experience in numerous areas in computer sciences and software engineering, which turns into a nightmare when I was looking for a job as I usually find my experience hard to match any job description.

Here's an incomplete list:

- Speech Deep Learning ([Target Speaker Extraction](https://github.com/med1844/TSE_7643), [TTS inference server](https://github.com/pipilapilayu/Bert-VITS-onnx-restful-server), SVC fine-tuning, data preprocessing, [maximum coverage slicer](https://github.com/pipilapilayu/TargetSpeakerEnhance/blob/master/slicer.py))
- Rust ([WASM](/2024/04/30/Predicting-FFXIV-Job-Choices-Based-on-Personality/), [CLI game](https://github.com/med1844/Sokoban)), currently learning async programming, tokio, actix and best practices
- Formal Verification using Coq, currently learning LEAN and z3
- Compiler (C++ LLVM Passes, [Regex Engine + LR(1) Front End](https://github.com/med1844/Toy-Compiler-Frontend), and even tools to [visualize LLVM IR](https://github.com/med1844/Drop-LLVM-IR-and-Visualize))
- Machine Learning (Random Forest, Bayesian)
- Computer Graphics / Game ([replicating minecraft with LWJGL](https://github.com/med1844/minecrash), Unity shader coding, pygame)
- Python Backend Development (flask, fastapi, jinja, HTML, JavaScript)
- Java Backend Development (JSP, Servlet, MVC), planning to learn Spring
- Front-end (React, tailwind-css)
- Desktop Apps ([PyQt6](https://github.com/pipilapilayu/ScreenAreaOCR-TTS), tkinter, electron + TypeScript)
- Web Scraping (requests, selenium, playwright)
- Scaling stuff (AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda, API Gateway), Cloudflare (workers, pages, D1), Docker, nginx)
- Reverse Engineering independent game save files ([The Blockheads](https://github.com/med1844/TheBlockheadsTools))
- Functional Programming (Haskell, OCaml, Lisp)
- Database (SQL, MongoDB, even implementing DBMS internals)
- Competitive Programming (Codeforces, AtCoder, some on-site contests with prizes that I refuse to disclose)
- Office Automation (use python to handle Excel, Word files, sending emails, etc.)

Besides programming I'm also an amateur mixing engineer, and very occasionaly work as producer.
